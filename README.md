# Firebase Bootstrap React Project
This is a simple project built with Firebase, Bootstrap and React that allows you to quickly create and manage data in a web application. The project uses Firebase to store and retrieve data, and React to render the user interface. The Bootstrap framework is used for styling the components.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Firebase Configuration
This project uses Firebase to store and retrieve data. To configure Firebase for your project, you'll need to create a Firebase project and add the configuration details to a .env file in the root of your project directory.

The .env file should look something like this:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_auth_domain_here"
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id_here"
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_storage_bucket_here"
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_messaging_sender_id_here"
REACT_APP_APP_ID="your_app_id_here"
```

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
